reflectives: <ul><li>This module taught me understand how crucial it is for businesses to take preventative action and put security measures in place. In addition, I was aware of the numerous security precautions and mitigating strategies that guard against unauthorized access to, disclosure of, change to, inspection of, documentation of, or destruction of information. My understanding of information security has improved as a result of the course material. Information security can only be achieved in the presence of confidentiality, availability, and data integrity. The knowledge was fresh and something I was not previously aware of. I also gained an understanding of the relevance of a risk management plan and how to manage threats to IT infrastructure effectively. This furthered my understanding of the many risks I may detect and manage in the organization's IT infrastructure areas as well as how to create a risk management plan. I think it is crucial for every individual in an organization to understand the value of risk management, risk identification techniques, risk mitigation strategies, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans. My knowledge from the training has significantly increased since I can put it to use in my current employment to encourage productive work efforts.</li></ul>
